    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h1>Purpose:</h1>
    <p>In this file I will try out the different features of HTML as I learn them.</p>

    <!-- The basics follow here: -->

    <h2>It is possible to make headers of different sizes!</h2>

    <h2>Images are done like this:</h2>
    <img src="https://instagram.fosl3-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/s320x320/89028352_2575687152716889_3064873496896077824_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fosl3-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_ohc=UreUyWVsXEoAX8EsBco&oh=b909e4335f672d49da16a7c40ac76379&oe=5F090C90" alt="Picture from Instagram" height="300" width="300"> <br>
    <p><img src="god S.jpeg" alt="Halvnakne skuespillere"  style="height: 300px; width: 400px; float: left;">
        You can make the image be on the right<br> 
        or left hand side of the text. </p> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/ZC0ATzzJnKqn2SNDHR" width="480" height="314" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed"
        allowFullScreen></iframe>
        <br>
    <p>See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_imagemap.asp">imagemap</a> to see how you can make
    clickable areas in images (containing links or a function of some sort).</p>
        

    <h2>Links are done like this:</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Link that you can click, but don't have to. It's a free
        country.</a>
    <p>
        It is also possible to link to a page within the same website using a relative URL (without the "https://www" part),
        <br>
        and decide whether the link should be opened up in a new tab/window using the target = "_blank" attribute. <br>
        Bookmarks are also possible to make, <a href="#Addr">like this</a>. See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links_bookmarks.asp" target="_blank">
        w3schools site on how to create bookmarks</a> to see how you can add a link to a bookmark on another page.<br>
        Furthermore, images can also be used as links:
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBOnA0ak4w">
    <img src="https://www.nfkino.no/sites/nfkino.no/files/styles/content_full/public/media-images/2019-11/svansjn_bolsjoj_web.jpg?itok=HnmejxYz" alt="Swan Lake" height="300" width="400">
    </a>
    <p>Lastly, we can have buttons containing links:</p>
    <button onclick="document.location = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk71bPz5VLo'">Entertain me!</button>

    <h2>Iframes:</h2>
    <p>Iframes are used to display a webpage witin a webpage. <br></p>
    <iframe src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp" style="height: 200px; width: 400px;"></iframe>
    <p>Iframes can also be used as target for a link. To do this you name the iframe using name="*name*", and refer to the name as the target for the link.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Styles:</h2>
    <p>There are multiple styles that can be used:</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">The text can be in different sizes.</p>
    <p style="font-family: fantasy;">The font can be different.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center">The text can be aligned differently.</p>
    <p style="background-color: orangered;">The background-color can be different.</p>
    <p style="color: green;">The text can be in different colors.</p>
    <p style="border: 3px solid purple;">The text can have a colored border.</p>
    

    <h2>Text formating:</h2>
    <p>
        The text can be formated in multiple different ways: <br>
        <b>Bold text. No extra importance.</b> <br>
        <strong>Strong text. This defines text of extra importance.</strong> <br>
        <i>This is used for technical terms, words from other languages, etc.</i> <br>
        <em>This is used to emphasize text.</em> <br>
        <small>Small text.</small> <br>
        <mark>Marked/highlighted text.</mark> <br>
        <del>"Deleted" text.</del> <br>
        <ins>"Inserted" text. (Underlined).</ins> <br>
        <sub>Subscripted text</sub> and <sup>superscripted text.</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p title="What are you looking here for?">The title attribute enables you to show some text when you hover the mouse over
        whatever element you are creating.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Horizontal rules:</h2>
    <p>To separate content or define a change, the "hr"-element can be used to create a horizontal line, like the one above 
        this heading.
    </p>

    <h2>Linebreak:</h2>
    <p>If I only use enter when writing,
        this happens.
    </p>
    <p>By using the "br"-element <br> this happens.</p>

    <h2>Pre-element:</h2>
    <pre>
        The pre-element preserves both space and line breaks, as well as the font.
        This is especially useful for poems, song lyrics, etc.
    </pre>

    <h2>Code:</h2>
    <p>Use code-element to display code in your document.</p>
    <code>
        x = 1;<br>
        y = 2;<br>
        z = x + y;<br>
    </code>
    <p>Tips: If you don't want to write br for every line, you can have the code-element within a pre-element.<br>
    For <i>variables</i> (in mathematics or programming) use var-element.</p>

    <h2>Bi-directional Override:</h2>
    <bdo dir="rtl"> We can write text from right to left.</bdo>

    <h2>Entities:</h2>
    <p>
        Some characters are reserved in HTML. To display them, write <code>&entityName</code>. <br>
        It is also possible to use entity numbers, <code>&#entityNumber</code>, which are harder to remember, but are supported
        almost everywhere.<br>
        The entity name of &lt; is lt, and &gt; is gt. <br>
        Another common entity is &amp;nbsp, non-breaking space, which ensures that there wil be no linebreak at that space.
    </p>
    <h3>Symbol Entities:</h3>
    <p>There are many symbols not usually found on a keyboard that can be added to an HTML-page. Here are some examples: </p>
    <h4>Mathematical Symbols:</h4>
    <p>&forall;, &part;, &exist;, &empty;, &nabla;, &isin;, &notin;, &prod; and &sum;.</p>
    <h4>Emojis:</h4>
    <p>Emojis are also a part of the UTF-8 alphabet, and can be accessed through their entity number &#128513; <br>
    For full list of emojis and their entity numbers, check out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp">
    this link</a>. <br>
    Remember that emojis, like any other characters, can be sized using style="font-size:*size*".</p>
    <h4>Other Symbols:</h4>
    <p>&copy;, &reg;, &euro;, &larr;, &spades;, etc. There are also a lot more, including the greek letters and currency symbols.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Table:</h2>
    <table><!--Could define the width of the table, for instance 100%-->
        <caption>Table</caption>
        <tr>
            <th>First name</th>
            <th>Last name</th>
            <th>Age</th>
            <th colspan="2">Telephone number</th> <!--Can also have rowspan, one cell spanning multiple rows-->
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Erling</td>
            <td>Tveter</td>
            <td>23</td>
            <td>+47 93 02 66 56</td>
            <td>+47 66 77 77 68</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>To add a style to a specific table, first give the table an id, and then use that to choose the style in your css-document.<br>
    You can read more about how it is done <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Unordered list:</h2>
    <p>Inside the ul, you can decide what shape the points should have by using style="list-style-type:square/disc/circle/none".
        By default the shape is disc, which is what you see here.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cross-country skiing</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Classical</li>
                <li>Skating</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Athletics</li>
        <li>Volleyball</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To create a horizontal list, a navigation menu, check out 
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_lists_menu">this example</a>.
        The key is to use the CSS-property float: left on the list items.
    </p>

    <h2>Ordered list:</h2>
    <p>
        Inside the ol you can decide whether the list should be ordered using numbers, letters or roman numbers. <br>
        In the case of letters and roman numbers you can also choose whether they should be upper- or lowercase. <br>
        All of this is done using type="1(default)/A/a/I/i".
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Marit Bjørgen</li>
        <li>Ole Einar Bjørndalen</li>
        <li>Bjørn Dæhlie</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is also possible to start the list at another number than 1 by using start="*The number*"</p>

    <h2>Description list:</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Petter Northug</dt>
        <dd>- skier</dd>
        <dt>Jakob Ingebrigtsen</dt>
        <dd>- runner</dd>
    </dl>

    <hr>

    <h2>Block-level element:</h2>
    <div style="background-color: bisque;">
        <p>A block-level element starts on a new line and takes up all the width available. <br>
        Use the div-element as a container for other elements to make them block-level.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Inline elements:</h2>
    <p>
        Inline elements do not start a new line, and only uses the width necessary. You can use the 
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 196, 0);">span</span>-element to make for instance text-elements inline.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Classes:</h2>
    <p>
        You can define an element's class using class="*The class*" and then set a style for every element in that class in your css-document. <br>
        In the css-file the class is referred to using .*class name*, or in the case of an inline class, span.*class name*. <br>
        Note that the class name is case sensitive.
        It is also possible to have a single element be a part of several classes.
    </p>

    <h2>IDs:</h2>
    <p>
        The id attribute has to  be unique within the HTML-file, and can be referred to in the CSS-file using #*The ID*.
        The id is case sensitive and <b>cannot</b> contain any white space. <br>
        Note the difference between class and id: An id only refers to a single element, wheras a class may refer to multiple elements.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Layout:</h2>
    <p>When it comes to layout, it seems we have to trust in our future selves, learning CSS. It seems like the easiest is to use 
        a CSS Framework, but CSS Flexbox may be the most versitile.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsive Web Design:</h2>
    <h3>Setting the Viewport:</h3>
    <p>The viewport sets the page's scaling and dimensions. Use the meta I have used in this document.</p>
    <h3>Responsive Images:</h3>
    <p>
        Often nice to use max-width:100%, which will make the image scale down if it has to, but never exceed its original size. 
        The height can be set to auto. <br>
        By using the picture- and source-elements, it is possible to show different images for different browser window sizes.
    </p>
    <h3>Responsive Text:</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 2vw;">
        By using the vw-unit, the text size will follow the size of the browser window.
    </p>
    <h3>Media Queries:</h3>
    <p>
        Can change the layout based on the size of the browser window. For instance make elements display horizontally on large 
        screens and vertically on smaller screens. <br>
        First define how it should look on large screens, and then use <br>
        <code>@media screen and (max-width: *number*px)</code> <br>
        to define how it should look when the browser window is less than *number* pixels wide.
    </p>

    <h2>Semantic Elements:</h2>
    <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer, unlike for instance div and span.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Section</dt>
            <dd>- defines a section in the document.</dd>
        <dt>Article</dt>
            <dd>- specifies independent, self-contained content.</dd>
            <dd>- should make sense on its own. Can be read independently of the rest of the webpage.</dd>
        <dt>Header</dt>
            <dd>- specifies a header for a document or section.</dd>
            <dd>- should be used as a container for introductory content.</dd>
        <dt>Footer</dt>
            <dd>- specifies a footer for a document or section.</dd>
            <dd>- should contain information about its containing element.</dd>
            <dd>- typically contains the author of the document, copyright information, links to terms of use, contact information, etc.</dd>
        <dt>Nav</dt>
            <dd>- defines a set of navigation links.</dd>
            <dd>- not all links should be in nav, only the major ones.</dd>
        <dt>Aside</dt>
            <dd>- defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).</dd>
            <dd>- should be related to the surrounding content.</dd>
        <dt>Figure</dt>
            <dd>- should group together image and figcaption.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>There are also several other semantic elements, like time.</p>

    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>We will now have a closer look at some CSS-properties that we have not already covered.</p>

    <h2>Transparency:</h2>
    <p>
        When using rgba or hsla for color, you can add a fourth number which defines how transperent the color should be.
        1 is normal and 0 is completely transperent. <br>
        If you are using a name for a color instead of an rgb/hex/hsl, then you can use the <code>opacity</code>-element to
        specify the transparency of the color. <br>
        NB! If you use the opacity property on a background element, the text within that element will inherit the same
        transparency making it hard to read. Using rgba or hsla prevents this inheritance.
    </p>
    <h2>Background-image:</h2>
    <p>Just like you can set a background-color, you can also set a Background-image. By default the image is repeated so 
        it covers the entire element. <br>
        To only repeat an image horizontally, use <code>background-repeat: repeat-x</code>. To only repeat vertically, 
        use <code>background-repeat: repeat-y</code>. <br>
        If you don't want the image to repeat, use <code>background-repeat: no-repeat</code>. <br>
        By using <code>background-position: *location*</code> you can place the image where you want. <br>
        Use <code>background-attachment: fixed</code> to fixate the background-image such that it stays the same place on the
        screen even when scrolling. Use <code>background-attachment: scroll</code> to make the image scroll like the rest of
        the page.
    </p>

    <h2>Borders:</h2>
    <p>
        First, you have to decide the style of the border, by using the border-style property. There are a number of different 
        opportunities, including dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, etc. It is also possible to use a mix. Check out
        this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp">link</a> to see all the different styles. <br>
        Border width can be chosen using the <code>border-witdh</code> property, and it is also possible to choose different widths
        for the different parts of the border. Same with the border color. <br>
        Instead of writing a line with different styles, colors, and/or widths in order to get the mixed border you want, you can 
        write explicitly how each side should look by using <code>border-top-style</code> for instance. <br>
        For rounded corners on your border, use <code>border-radius: *number*px</code>.
    </p>
